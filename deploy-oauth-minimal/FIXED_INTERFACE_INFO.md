# Google Client Library Interface Fix

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve issues with the Google API Client library's missing interfaces.

## Issue

The error being resolved was:

```
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "Google\Auth\GetUniverseDomainInterface" not found in 
/var/www/DK_Dental_Studio/deploy-oauth-minimal/vendor/google/apiclient/src/Client.php:212
```

This error occurred because the minimal Google API Client implementation was missing the `Google\Auth\GetUniverseDomainInterface` class, which was added in a newer version of the library.

## Solution

Rather than updating the entire Google API Client library (which would increase the size and complexity), we've implemented a targeted fix by:

1. Creating a custom `Google\Auth\GetUniverseDomainInterface` interface with the required `DEFAULT_UNIVERSE_DOMAIN` constant
2. Implementing a simple `Google\Auth\UniverseDomain` class that provides the functionality needed
3. Updating the auth scripts to handle any potential errors with more useful error messages

## Files Added/Modified

- **New Files:**
  - `/vendor/google/apiclient/src/Auth/GetUniverseDomainInterface.php` - The missing interface
  - `/vendor/google/apiclient/src/Auth/UniverseDomain.php` - An implementation of the interface
  - `/prepare-deployment.php` - Script to validate the fix and create a deployment package

- **Modified Files:**
  - `owner-auth.php` - Added error handling and interface checks
  - `owner-callback.php` - Added error handling and interface checks

## How to Test

You can run the `prepare-deployment.php` script to verify everything is working:

```
php prepare-deployment.php
```

This will:
1. Check that all necessary files exist
2. Test that the Google Client can be instantiated without errors
3. Create a deployment zip file if all checks pass

## Future Maintenance

If you need to update the Google API Client in the future, you have two options:

1. **Keep the minimal approach**: Just verify that any new interfaces or classes used by the Client.php file are properly implemented
   
2. **Switch to full Composer installation**: If you prefer, you can replace the minimal implementation with a full Composer installation:
   ```
   composer require google/apiclient:^2.15.0
   ```

## Security Note

Remember that this implementation contains sensitive client secrets. Always ensure the `secure` directory has proper permissions and is not accessible from the web.
